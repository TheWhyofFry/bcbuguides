      <description>Foreword This guide is intended for beginner/intermediate users of general Bioinformatics tools. The end goal being successful usage of the CHPC and cluster environments in general. Since skill levels vary, I&amp;rsquo;ve included a preamble that will cover general execution of commands from a shell and how, with advancement of general computing has allowed us to scale up processes that would elsewise take longer to run than it does to write up a thesis - or a supervisor to evaluate said thesis :-)</description>

      <description>Making the most out of a little bash Up to now, we&amp;rsquo;ve used BASH scripts to do simple stuff. Generated PBS scrtips with variable names (such as paths to our inputs). I&amp;rsquo;ve only done a moderate amount of intermediate BASH, but it&amp;rsquo;s very useful. This document is all about how to make your life easier when you have loads of sequence data from multitple samples.
In a hypothetical experiment, we have two replicates for three different conditions.</description>
